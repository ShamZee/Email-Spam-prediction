# Spam-Email-prediction

Now a days email is the best and secure way way of communication, some time there unnecessary and fake email come from different websites and rebort so which are harmful for our email box, so here comes machine learning models which predict and send them into spam box and do not show us in our main inbox.

So I have trained machine learning model which is MultinomialNB and their accuracy is 0.970 but the precision is 1 which is best for this problem because we do not want to miss our important email so the model is accurate in this scenario but on the other hand it can do some mistake but 97% accuracy is enough.
